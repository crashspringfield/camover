##About

camover1984 is a user-driven app for documenting CCTV using google's map API. check out an
[interactive demo](https://crashspringfield.github.io/camover-demo/#/) where you can get a feel
for the app and placing cameras but won't be able to save anything.

camover1984 is a RESTful API built using a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJs, and Nodejs) stack.

##Contributing

There are always things that need worked on:

    bot/hack prevention:

        --> general injection fricks
        
    aesthetics
    
    other features or ways to improve?
