  <p>Even if computers aren't your thing, feel free to sugguest features and new
    ways of doing things</p>
  <br>
  <h4>resources</h4>
  <p>We're always looking for more refernces to add to <a ui-sref="references">our list of resources</a>
    on security culture, survelliance, encryption, and other things people can do
    to keep themselves safe.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>finances</h4>
  <p>Like it or not, we exist under capitalism. Hosting, domain names, and database
    storage all cost money. Upkeep takes time. If you have cash to spare, donations
    are what keeps this going</p>
